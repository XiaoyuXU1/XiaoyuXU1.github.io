# 😊 About Me 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, co-supervised by [Prof. Haibo Hu](https://haibohu.org/) and [Dr. Minxin Du](https://duminxin.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2024.  

### Research Interests

- **Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs):** efficient algorithms for selectively “forgetting” specific data in pre-trained LLMs—removing unwanted knowledge while preserving overall performance, without retraining from scratch.  
- **Understanding of LLMs:** analyzing internal parameter–feature relationships to interpret how weight patterns shape model behavior.
