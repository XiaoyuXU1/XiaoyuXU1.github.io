# About Me  

I am a Ph.D. candidate at **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University**, co-supervised by [**Prof. Haibo Hu**](https://haibohu.org/) and [**Dr. Minxin Du**](https://duminxin.github.io/). My research focuses on the **security, privacy, and reliability of large language models (LLMs)**. Before starting my Ph.D., I received my **B.Eng. in Electronics and Communication Engineering** from **Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)** in 2024.  


## Research Interests  

- **Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models (LLMs):**  
  Designing efficient and robust algorithms that enable LLMs to selectively *forget* specific data while preserving their overall capability.  My research explores two key scenarios: (i) **Single Unlearning:** Removing a specific set of data or knowledge from a pre-trained model in a one-time unlearning request. (ii) **Continual Unlearning:** Extending unlearning to long sequences of deletion requests, addressing catastrophic forgetting.  

- **LLM Security and Trustworthiness:**  
  Investigating the robustness of LLMs against unlearning attacks like relearning and quantization perturbations to ensure safety and integrity in real-world applications.
